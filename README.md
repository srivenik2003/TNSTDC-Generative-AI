Problem Statement:
Creating abstract art involves a high degree of creativity and experimentation, which can be challenging for many artists. Moreover, not everyone has access to the necessary tools, materials, or expertise to explore abstract art fully. There is a need for a tool that can assist artists in generating abstract artworks without the need for extensive artistic skills or resources.
Description:
"Generative AI for Abstract Art Creation" refers to the development of an artificial intelligence system capable of autonomously producing abstract artworks. This technology harnesses machine learning algorithms to generate visually compelling and non-representational art pieces. Through user-defined parameters such as color schemes, styles, and moods, the AI generates unique abstract compositions, offering a novel approach to artistic expression and creativity.
